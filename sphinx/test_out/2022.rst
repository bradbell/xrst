1.  Change the heading level separator character from period ``.``
    to at sign ``@``; see links to headings
    :ref:`xsrst.py@links_to_headings@other_levels`.
2.  Add period ``.`` to the list of valid characters in a
    :ref:`begin_cmd@section_name`.
3.  Change the following section names in the xsrst documentation:

*****
1.  Require that the suspend and resume commands are in their own line; see
    :ref:`suspend_cmd`.
2.  A problem was fixed the table corresponding to the
    :ref:`xsrst.py@command_line_arguments@line_increment` table.
    To be specific, the indices in the rst file were one larger than
    they should have been.

    :ref:`xsrst.py@wish_list@git_repository` entries to wish list.
