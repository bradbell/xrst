=====
#. Add python 3.13 to testing,
   drop python 3.8 from testing,
   and require python greater than or equal 3.9.
   (Python 3.13 release date, and 3.8 end of life date, is 2024-10-07.)

=====
There was a bug in the error message when a single or double quote in the
output of the :ref:`config_file@input_files` command.
This has been fixed.

02-18
=====
#. A :ref:`spell_cmd@spell_off` command would not be recognized
   if it was in the first line of a :ref:`template_cmd@template_file`  .
   This has been fixed.
   An example of spell_off in the first line of a template file
   was added under :ref:`example_expansion_one@This Template File`
   in the template example expansions.
#. The last entry in the list of :ref:`purpose@Features`
   on the purpose page was edited and moved to be the first entry.

02-15
=====

02-03
=====
Add ``bin/group_list.sh``
and ``.readthedocs.yaml`` to the ``bin/dev_tools.sh`` development tools.

01-24
=====
#. The template file item in the
   :ref:`wish_list@Spell Checking` wish list was removed
   because it was completed on
   :ref:`2024-10-25 <2024@mm-dd@10-25>` .
#. An external link item was added to the Spell Checking wish list.

01-11
=====
Fix some problems when running xrst with
:ref:`run_xrst@target` equal to ``tex`` .

01-10
=====
#. Include the :ref:`version <user-guide@Versions>` in this documentation.
#. Use the tomli package instead of the toml package; see
   `tomli <https://github.com/hukkin/tomli>`_ .

01-05
=====
Conda Forge does not yet handle dependencies that are different for
different systems.
It was therefore decided to totally remove pyenchant
as a requirement when installing xrst.
In the same spirit, only the default html theme furo is a requirement.
If you use the pyenchant spell checker or one of the other themes,
and it is not installed, you will get a message suggesting that you install it.


01-04
=====
1. Remove the pyenchant install requirement on windows; see
   :ref:`user-guide@Dependencies` .
2. Create the stable-2025 branch and its first release; see
   :ref:`user-guide@Versions` .

01-03
=====
Improve the discussion of spelling errors in the
:ref:`get_started-name` example.
