=====
Conda Forge does not yet handle dependencies that are different for
different systems.
It was therefore decided to totally remove pyenchant
as a requirement when installing xrst.
In the same spirit, only the default html theme furo is a requirement.
If you use the pyenchant spell checker or one of the other themes,
and it is not installed, you will get a message suggesting that you install it.
