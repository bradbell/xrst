=====
#. If you used ``docstring_example`` for a :ref:`begin_cmd@page_name`
   and there was a spelling error in that page,
   ``xrst`` would stop at a breakpoint before reporting the spelling error.
   This has been fixed.
#. It was possible for the assert below to fail.
   This has been changed into an error message::

      assert page_name == 'xrst_table_of_contents'

#. The information and suggestions printed below the spelling warnings
   has been improved.

#. The :ref:`get_started-name` example was simplified by using
   the stable release for 2024.

#. A stable version of the documentation was created; see
   :ref:`user-guide@Versions` .

#. Each *file_name* in the latest documentation was moved
   (this is important if you have links to previous web pages):

   .. list-table::

      *  - Old Location
         - ``https://xrst.readthedocs.io/``\ *file_name*
      *  - New Location
         - ``https://xrst.readthedocs.io/latest/``\ *file_name*
