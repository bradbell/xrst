Words
*****
Each word, that is checked for spelling, is a sequence of letters.
Upper case letters start a new word (even when preceded by a letter).

.. _spell_cmd@Special Words:

Special Words
*************
In the syntax above, the special word list is

| *word_1* ... *word_n*

These words are considered correct spelling even though
they are not in the dictionary.
In the syntax above the special words are all in one line.
They could be on different lines which helps when displaying
the difference between  versions of the corresponding file.
Latex commands should not be in the special word list because
words that have a backslash directly before them
are not include in spell checking.

.. _spell_cmd@project_dictionary:

project_dictionary
******************
The list of words in the
:ref:`config_file@project_dictionary`
are considered correct spellings for all pages.
If multiple people are working on a project using different spell checkers,
the words that are correct in one spell checker and not another should
be included in the project_dictionary.

.. meta::
   :keywords: page_name

.. index:: page_name

.. _spell_cmd@page_name:

page_name
*********
The words in the :ref:`begin_cmd@page_name`
are considered correct spellings for that page.

.. index:: capital, letters

.. _spell_cmd@Capital Letters:

Capital Letters
***************
The case of the first letter does not matter when checking spelling;
e.g., if ``abcd`` is *word_1* then ``Abcd`` will be considered a valid word.
Each capital letter starts a new word; e.g., `CamelCase` is considered to
be the two words 'camel' and 'case'.
Single letter words are always correct and not included in the
special word list; e.g., the word list entry ``CppAD`` is the same as ``Cpp``.

.. index:: double, words

.. _spell_cmd@Double Words:

Double Words
************
It is considered an error to have only white space between two occurrences
of the same word in an xrst input file.
You can make an exception for this by entering
the same word twice (next to each other) in the special word list;
for example `house house` occurs here and in the special word list
for this file.

Double words errors can occur in the output the user sees, but not be
in the corresponding xrst input. For example the xrst input:
::

   `python package index <https://pypi.org/>`_ index.

results in the output:
`python package index <https://pypi.org/>`_ index.
There is no double word entry for index in the special words list
for this page and there is no corresponding double word spelling error.
