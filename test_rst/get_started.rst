Heading: Steps
**************

#. Use pip as follows to install the most recent stable version of xrst::

      pip install xrst

#. Create an empty directory and make it your current working directory.

#. Create a file called ``xrst.toml`` (the xrst configure file)
   in the working directory with the following contents::

      [root_file]
      default = 'get_started.xrst'

   This is the xrst configure file.

#. Create a file called ``get_started.xrst``, in the working directory,
   with the contents of
   :ref:`this example file<get_started@Heading: This Example File>` .

#. Execute the following command::

      xrst

#. Use your web browser to open the file below
   (this file name is relative to your working directory)::

      build/html/get_started.html

#. You may have gotten spelling warnings because the spell checker
   you are using is different from the one used to test xrst.
   You can fix these warning by adding or removing words in the
   spell command at the beginning of the get_started.xrst file.
   If you do this correctly and re-execute the xrst command,
   the spelling warnings should not appear.

#. You should have gotten a warning that none of the input_files commands
   succeeded. These commands are used to check if all the input files get used.
   You can remove this check by adding the text below at the end of your
   xrst.toml file::

      [input_files]
      data = [ ]

   If you then re-execute the xrst command, the input files
   warning should not appear.
